# gravitationalPull
This is a Gravitational Pull Visualization project. This interactive web application demonstrates the gravitational influence of the Moon on Earth's water bodies, showcasing how this pull creates tidal waves. Users can toggle the moon and observe fluctuations in wave patterns, providing a visual understanding of gravitational forces in action.
